"Gallefreyan Gold"
We need your help, an evil race of angry robots called the Daleks are invading the minds of our youths by probing themselves 
into our videogames! If you control the youth, you control the world. And thats one step closer to taking over the universe!
Show them that we're not going to take it! We're going to go in there, collect our good ol' Gallifreyan Gold, and break 
their hold over our world. Now, come along! Allons-y!

Instructions
	-Collect all of the Gallifreyan Gold to proceed ever more closer to defeating the Daleks.
	-If you should run into an enemy, I, The Doctor, will teleport us back through time
	to try again. Lets get 'em!
